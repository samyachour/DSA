/*
 We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Library Management System:
 
 Any library member should be able to search books by their title, author, subject category as well by the publication date.
 
 Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a rack number which will help to locate the book.
 
 There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.
 
 The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.
 
 There should be a maximum limit on how many books a member can check-out.
 
 The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the due date.
 
 Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.
 
 The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved books become available, as well as when the book is not returned within the due date.
 
 The system will be able to read barcodes from books and membersâ€™ library cards.
